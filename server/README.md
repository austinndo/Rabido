### **_Description_**

#### Rabido is a website that connects freelancers offering services with businesses/individuals. The freelancer creates a profile to showcase their skillsets. Once the account is created, the freelancer will be able to make updates to their profile accordingly. The client/business signs up to view freelancers and their skills on the feed. The client is also able to filter their search to find a freelancer with the specific skills required. Once finding the right person for their project they are able to reach out to further inquire about their skills and past work.

### **Getting Started**

#### The landing page will prompt the user to either sign in or sign up. When signing up the user will be asked to check a box to indicate if they are a "Mark"(freelancer) or a "Hunter"(customer). If the user is a "Mark" they will be navigated to a profile form where they will be able to create profile. Once a profile is made, they can review their portolio page and make any updates as necessary. If user is a "Hunter" they will be navigated to the feed, where they can start their search.
